## Introduction
This application is designed to detect and visualize protein interactions based on the confidence probabilities provided by the AlphaFold3 model. It allows users to deeply understand the complex interactions between proteins, which is crucial for various biological and medical research.

## About AlphaFold3

AlphaFold3 is a state-of-the-art protein structure prediction tool developed by DeepMind. It uses deep learning techniques to predict the three-dimensional structures of proteins based purely on their amino acid sequences. This technology represents a significant breakthrough in the field of bioinformatics, offering high accuracy predictions that were previously not possible without experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy.

The technology behind AlphaFold is based on the use of deep neural networks that model the spatial relationships between amino acids in a protein. By predicting the distance and angles between pairs of amino acids, AlphaFold can construct a highly accurate 3D model of a proteinâ€™s structure. This capability is crucial for understanding protein function and interaction, which has far-reaching implications for drug discovery, disease understanding, and biological research.

### Importance in This Application
